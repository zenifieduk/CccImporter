  "fullDescription": "## About Goodwood Revival\n\nThe Goodwood Revival celebrates the halcyon days of motor racing as it was in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. It is the world's most celebrated historic motor racing event and the only event of its kind to be staged entirely in the nostalgic time capsule of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.\n\nThe event is a magical step back in time to the romance and glamour of motor racing as it used to be. It is the world's most popular historic motor race meeting and the only sporting event of its kind to be staged entirely in the nostalgic time capsule of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s that relives the glory days of Goodwood Motor Circuit.\n\nOn the track, you'll see rare and priceless cars of the period racing wheel-to-wheel, while off-track the event is a celebration of fashion and music from the post-war decades.",
